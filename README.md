Predicting the value of FiFa soccer players.

This is a group project for the class Business Analytics and Data Science Applications at the University of St.Gallen. 

Using FiFa Data from https://sports-statistics.com/soccer/, we predicted the value of soccer players with machine learning techniques and compared it to their actual values. This enabled us to detect whether and if so by how much players are over- or undervalued. In an interactive Web App, users can use this information to detect which players should be replaced due to being overvalued and which players are a good buy.
